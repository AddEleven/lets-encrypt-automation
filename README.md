Azure Let's Encrypt Certificate Automation
Generate-Lets-Encrypt-Certificate

This repository contains an automated solution for creating, renewing, and managing Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS certificates using GitHub Actions and Azure services. The certificates are stored in Azure Key Vault for easy consumption by your Azure applications.

Features
üîÑ Automated renewals - Runs on the 1st and 15th of every month
üîí Secure storage - Certificates stored in Azure Key Vault
üîç DNS validation - Uses Azure DNS for domain ownership validation
üß™ Testing support - Optional staging environment for testing without rate limits
üîÑ Version management - Automatically disables old certificate versions
Prerequisites
Azure Resources
You need the following Azure resources set up:

Azure DNS Zone - For domain validation

Must contain the domain you're generating certificates for
Example: example.com DNS Zone for app.example.com certificates
Azure Key Vault - For certificate storage

Must have sufficient access policies for the service principal
GitHub Repository Configuration
Repository Secrets (Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Secrets)
Secret	Description
AZURE_CLIENT_ID	Azure service principal client ID
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET	Azure service principal secret
AZURE_TENANT_ID	Azure tenant ID
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID	Azure subscription ID
LETS_ENCRYPT_EMAIL	Email for Let's Encrypt registration
KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_NAME	Name of your Azure Key Vault
Repository Variables (Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Variables)
Variable	Description
DOMAIN_NAME	Domain for certificate (e.g., app.example.com)
AZURE_DNS_ZONE_NAME	Azure DNS Zone name (e.g., example.com)
Required Permissions
Service Principal Permissions
The service principal used by GitHub Actions requires:

Key Vault Permissions
Certificates: Get, List, Import, Update
Secrets: Get, List, Set
DNS Zone Permissions
DNS Zone Contributor - To create TXT records for domain validation
GitHub Actions Permissions
The workflow uses the following permissions:

id-token: write - For Azure login
contents: read - For repository access
How It Works
Certificate Generation Process
Workflow Trigger

Runs on a schedule (1st and 15th of each month)
Can be triggered manually with optional staging parameter
Certificate Check

Checks if certificate exists in Key Vault
Calculates days until expiry
Skips renewal if more than 30 days left
Certificate Generation

Uses Posh-ACME to interact with Let's Encrypt
Uses Azure DNS for domain validation
Generates a PFX certificate
Key Vault Storage

Imports certificate to Key Vault with generated name: cert-domain-name
Example: cert-app-example-com
Version Management

Identifies the newly imported certificate
Disables all older versions of the certificate
Workflow File
The GitHub Actions workflow (generate-cert.yml) handles:

Scheduling certificate renewals
Azure authentication
Running the PowerShell script
PowerShell Script
The PowerShell script (create-lets-encrypt-cert.ps1) handles:

Checking for existing certificates
Interacting with Let's Encrypt
Managing certificate versions in Key Vault
Usage
Automatic Renewals
Certificates are automatically renewed when they're within 30 days of expiry. No action required.

Manual Certificate Generation
Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
Select "Generate-Lets-Encrypt-Certificate" workflow
Click "Run workflow"
Optionally select "Use Lets Encrypt staging environment" for testing
Click "Run workflow"
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
DNS Validation Failures

Ensure the service principal has DNS Zone Contributor permissions
Check that the DNS Zone matches the domain's parent zone
Key Vault Access Issues

Verify the service principal has proper Key Vault access policies
Check for "Access denied" errors in the workflow logs
Rate Limit Errors

Use the staging environment for testing to avoid hitting Let's Encrypt production rate limits
Ensure you're not requesting too many certificates for the same domain
Debug Logging
The script outputs detailed information about:

Certificate expiry dates
Certificate versions and thumbprints
Disabled certificate versions
